# Polymorphic Worm
This is the repository for IISc E0-256 course project on Polymorphic Malware written in python

____________________

The replicate.py file contains the code to initialize the malware

To run it, execute

*python replicate.py*

Yes, it's that simple!

____________________

After the malware is initialized, run it by executing:

*./<name_of_file>* or *python <name_of_file>*

____________________

The malware has been stripped off it's infinite loop, so that it creates only one copy of itself after each execution
